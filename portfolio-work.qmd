Below are some of my past projects, publications, and consultant work from clients, national labs, and internships.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Consulting

-   **Evaluation, Measurement & Verification (EM&V) Overview**\
    [EM&V Overview](portfolio_files/emv_doc.pdf) - An introduction to the principles of EM&V, which ensures that energy efficiency programs achieve their intended results. While my client-based EM&V work is proprietary, I regularly conduct impact assessments, data analysis, and reporting to validate energy savings for utilities.\

-   **Heat Pump Metering Study**\
    [Heat Pump Metering Study](portfolio_files/heat_pump_metering_study.pdf) - A comprehensive study on heat pump efficiency in Massachusetts and Connecticut during winter months. I supported the analytics team by processing large datasets to assess seasonal performance and survey responses. <iframe src="portfolio_files/heat_pump_metering_study.pdf" width="100%" height="400px"></iframe>

-   **National Residential Efficiency Measures Database (REMD)**\
    [National Residential Efficiency Measures Database (REMD)](https://remdb.nrel.gov/about) - As part of a team updating the REMD dataset, I helped scrape retail energy pricing data and develop regression models to predict pricing trends for modelers and researchers.

### Research & Publications

-   **Hydrogen Storage System Design Tool**\
    [Hydrogen Publication](portfolio_files/hydrogen_publication.pdf) - My first-author publication on a computational tool for designing adsorbent hydrogen storage systems in fuel cell vehicles. The tool integrates material properties, thermodynamic equations, and system-level modeling to optimize hydrogen storage performance. <iframe src="portfolio_files/hydrogen_publication.pdf" width="100%" height="400px"></iframe>

-   **Pressure Plug Patent Request**\
    [Pressure Plug Patent Request](portfolio_files/pressure_plug_patent_request.pdf) - A patent submission for a low-profile, high-pressure hydrogen tank plug designed for submarine applications. I developed a CAD model for manufacturing and assisted in creating a test plan to validate performance under high pressure.\

-   **National Lab E-Database Idea Pitch**\
    [National Lab E-Database Pitch](portfolio_files/national_lab_edatabase_idea_pitch.pdf) - My proposal for a centralized electronic research database to improve time efficiency and knowledge-sharing across the national lab. <iframe src="portfolio_files/national_lab_edatabase_idea_pitch.pdf" width="100%" height="400px"></iframe>

-   **National Lab Research**\
    ![National Lab Research](portfolio_files/national_lab_research.gif)\
    A few images from my time at the national lab. I worked on flow cell batteries in glove boxes and explored novel 3D printing techniques. The syringe extruder shown was used for preliminary testing of wet carbon fiber-reinforced cement, with frosting and toothpaste serving as test materials for easy cleanup. (It also makes for a fun story.)

### Internships

-   **Internship at Nuclear Power Plant**\
    ![Internship at Nuclear Power Plant](portfolio_files/internship_dcpp.png)\
    A collage from my time interning at Californiaâ€™s only nuclear power plant, where I gained hands-on experience in power generation and system operations.

    -   **Nuclear Power Plant Systems Drawing**\
        ![Nuclear Power Plant Systems Drawing](portfolio_files/nuclear_powerplant_systems_drawing.png)\
        A schematic I developed during my internship to illustrate the power generation cycle. I found it quite useful for understanding thermodynamic principles in action.

-   **Internship for Mechanical Design**\
    ![Internship for Mechanical Design](portfolio_files/internship_loram.png)\
    This Canada-based internship focused on mechanical design for railway maintenance equipment. One of the more amusing moments was a company-wide gathering where we formed a maple leaf, wore red noses, and received bottles of maple syrup as gifts.
