    "text": "Engineer. Analyst. Community Builder. Creative Mind.\nI’ve always been someone who finds patterns, whether in numbers, cities, or the ways people interact. My background is in engineering and data analytics, which means I spend a lot of time making sense of complex systems and turning data into insights. I’ve worked with national labs, energy consultants, and non-profit initiatives—all with the goal of making communities stronger and more sustainable. I love taking complex information, making sense of it, and using it to drive real change.\nBut life isn’t just about logic and structure; creativity and human connection matter just as much to me. Outside of spreadsheets and strategy sessions, I’m dancing, writing, reading, and highly engaged with my local community. I love how art, music, and storytelling bring people together, and I try to infuse that same spirit of collaboration into everything I do—whether it’s working on a community project, mentoring others in data analysis, or simply sharing a great conversation. I believe the strongest communities are built at the intersection of different disciplines, where data meets storytelling, and structure meets spontaneity.\nThis site is a mix of everything I love—data, creativity, and community. Feel free to look around, and if you see something that sparks an idea, let’s connect!"

    "text": "Bridging Data, Community, and Creativity\nHey there! I’m Carina Grady—an engineer, data analyst, and community advocate who loves bringing people and ideas together. My work blends technical expertise with creative expression and civic engagement, whether I’m analyzing data to support my client projects, brainstorming ways to strengthen my city’s local businesses, or engaging in deep discussions with my local community.\nI believe data can tell powerful stories, but so can movement, words, and human connection. That’s why, outside of my work in consulting and analytics, you’ll find me immersed in the arts—writing, reading, or attending events that bring my city to life. I love a good deep-dive into analytics just as much as I love a lively dance floor or a compelling poem.\nThis site is a reflection of all those things: data, creativity, and community. Take a look around, and if something sparks an idea, let’s connect!"
