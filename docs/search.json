    "text": "Engineer. Analyst. Community Builder. Creative Mind.\nI’ve always been someone who finds patterns, whether in numbers, cities, or the ways people interact. My background is in engineering and data analytics, which means I spend a lot of time making sense of complex systems and turning data into insights. I’ve worked with national labs, energy consultants, and non-profit initiatives—all with the goal of making communities stronger and more sustainable. I love taking complex information, making sense of it, and using it to drive real change.\nBut life isn’t just about logic and structure; creativity and human connection matter just as much to me. Outside of spreadsheets and strategy sessions, I’m dancing, writing, reading, and highly engaged with my local community. I love how art, music, and storytelling bring people together, and I try to infuse that same spirit of collaboration into everything I do—whether it’s working on a community project, mentoring others in data analysis, or simply sharing a great conversation. I believe the strongest communities are built at the intersection of different disciplines, where data meets storytelling, and structure meets spontaneity.\nThis site is a mix of everything I love—data, creativity, and community. Feel free to look around, and if you see something that sparks an idea, let’s connect!\n\n\n\nAlso a fanatic alpaca enthusiast, featuring my favorite picture in Peru!"

    "text": "I’ve always been drawn to the new and different: the ideas that push boundaries, challenge assumptions, and redefine what’s possible. Whether it’s uncovering patterns in data, questioning long-held beliefs in technology, or exploring the social forces that shape our world, I love the process of discovery. I’m drawn to understanding how things work—not just taking them at face value, but exploring different perspectives and possibilities to see what else might be there.\nThat’s why I find myself at the intersection of engineering, analytics, and the humanities. I know it might not seem like the most obvious combination (after all, there is left brain and right brain; numbers and logic on one side, stories and human experience on the other), but to me, they’re deeply connected.\n\n\n\nThree-Way Venn Diagram for Humanities, Engineering, and Analytics\n\n\nEngineering and analytics give us the tools to build and understand complex systems, from energy grids to economic models. But the humanities help us ask the right questions. They remind us that technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it shapes and is shaped by people, culture, and history. To truly innovate, we need both—the precision of data and the depth of human insight.\nData can reveal social truths that impacts every indiviudal, engineered solutions can be more effective when they consider human behavior, and storytelling and history can influence innovation. The world is built on connections between people, ideas, and disciplines. For me, the best way to make an impact is by embracing that interconnectedness, by considering what happens when we bring these fields together. This consideration fuels my curiosity, my work, and my passion for exploring the bigger picture."

    "text": "Bridging Data, Community, and Creativity\nHey there! I’m Carina Grady—an engineer, data analyst, and community advocate who loves bringing people and ideas together. My work blends technical expertise with creative expression and civic engagement, whether I’m analyzing data to support my client projects, brainstorming ways to strengthen my city’s local businesses, or engaging in deep discussions with my local community.\nI believe data can tell powerful stories, but so can movement, words, and human connection. That’s why, outside of my work in consulting and analytics, you’ll find me immersed in the arts—writing, reading, or attending events that bring my city to life. I love a good deep-dive into analytics just as much as I love a lively dance floor or a compelling poem.\nThis site is a reflection of all those things: data, creativity, and community.
