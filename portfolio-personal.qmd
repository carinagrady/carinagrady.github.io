Below are some of my research notes, opinion pieces, and project work related to environmental sustainability.

- **Hydroponics Project**  
  [Hydroponics Project](portfolio_files/hydroponics_project.pdf) - A hands-on project focused on hydroponic farming to address food insecurity. Our team designed a low-cost hydroponic system that can grow fresh produce year-round. The initiative partnered with seven community organizations and impacted over 2,000 people, mostly affecting children.

  - **Green New Deal Opinion Piece**  
  [Green New Deal Opinion Piece](portfolio_files/green_new_deal_opinon_piece.pdf) - A critical analysis of the Green New Deal, balancing its ambitious goals with the reality of current technology and energy infrastructure. I argue that while immediate action on climate change is necessary, the feasibility of a 100% renewable grid depends on a radical overhaul of energy storage, grid modernization, and potential inclusion of nuclear power.

- **Climate Change IPCC Report Notes**  
  [Climate Change IPCC Report Notes](portfolio_files/climate_change_ipcc_report_notes.pdf) - A comprehensive breakdown of the 2018 IPCC Report, along with insights from an engineering graduate class. My notes cover historical energy use, global emissions trends, legislative impacts, and projections of climate change consequences, including rising sea levels, increasing global temperatures, and sector-specific greenhouse gas emissions.
