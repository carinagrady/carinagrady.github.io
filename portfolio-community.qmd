Below are some of my research notes, opinion pieces, and volunteer work, mostly related to environmental sustainability.

-   **Hydroponics Project**\
    [Hydroponics Project](portfolio_files/hydroponics_project.pdf) - A hands-on project focused on hydroponic farming to address food insecurity. Our team designed a low-cost hydroponic system that can grow fresh produce year-round. The initiative partnered with seven community organizations and impacted over 2,000 people, mostly affecting children. <iframe src="portfolio_files/hydroponics_project.pdf" width="100%" height="400px"></iframe>
