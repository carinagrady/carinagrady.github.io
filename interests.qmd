# The Power of Interdisciplinary Thinking

I've always been drawn to the **new and different**: the ideas that push boundaries, challenge assumptions, and redefine what's possible. Whether it's uncovering patterns in data, questioning long-held beliefs in technology, or exploring the social forces that shape our world, I love the process of discovery. I'm drawn to **understanding how things work**—not just taking them at face value, but exploring **different perspectives and possibilities** to see what else might be there.

That's why I find myself at the intersection of **engineering, analytics, and the humanities**. I know it might not seem like the most obvious combination (after all, there is left brain and right brain; numbers and logic on one side, stories and human experience on the other), but to me, they're deeply connected.

Engineering and analytics give us the tools to build and understand complex systems, from energy grids to economic models. But the humanities help us ask the right questions. They remind us that technology doesn't exist in a vacuum; it shapes and is shaped by people, culture, and history. To truly innovate, we need both—the precision of data and the depth of human insight.

Data can reveal social truths that impacts every indiviudal, engineered solutions can be more effective when they consider human behavior, and storytelling and history can influence innovation. **The world is built on connections between people, ideas, and disciplines**. For me, the best way to make an impact is by embracing that **interconnectedness**, by considering what happens when we bring these fields together. This consideration fuels my curiosity, my work, and my passion for **exploring the bigger picture**.

Data science and machine learning aren’t just about building models—they’re about **understanding data, extracting insights, and making informed decisions**. Before diving into predictive algorithms or optimization strategies, it’s important to step back and see the **bigger picture** of how models apply to our everyday life.

The first table breaks down different modeling approaches, from **supervised and unsupervised learning** to **time-series analysis** and **probability-based methods**. These categories help define how data is used, whether it's predicting an outcome, grouping similar observations, or analyzing uncertainty.

But these aren’t just abstract technical concepts. Models like these help us make sense of the world. In a way, they’re not so different from how we think; after all, **our brains function like neural networks**, constantly learning from past experiences (our "training data", if you will) and adjusting based on new information. We don’t need massive datasets or code to do it, but the process is familiar: **we take in patterns, form expectations, and refine our judgment**.

| **Category**                 | **Models & Techniques**                                                                                                                    | **Purpose**                                          |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Supervised Learning**      | Classificaiton (SVM, KNN), Regression (Linear, Logistic, Advanced), Decision Trees (CART, Random Forests), Neural Networks (Deep Learning) | Uses labeled data to predict outcomes.               |
| **Unsupervised Learning**    | Clustering (k-Means, DBSCAN), Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)                                                                               | Finds patterns in unlabeled data.                    |
| **Time-Series Models**       | Forecasting (ARIMA, GARCH), Trend Analysis (Exponential Smoothing), Change Detection (CUSUM)                                               | Analyzes temporal dependencies for trend prediction. |
| **Probability-Based Models** | Distribution Fitting, A/B Testing, Markov Chains, Bayesian Statistics, Simulation                                                          | Models uncertainty and probabilistic relationships.  |

But models don’t exist in isolation. The second table walks through the full data modeling pipeline, from **preparing raw data** to **engineering meaningful features**, applying **descriptive, predictive, or prescriptive models**, and finally ensuring the model is **validated and deployable**. Each step plays a role in making data-driven decisions **more accurate, reliable, and actionable**.

In many ways, this process mirrors how we reason and navigate the world. We:

-   **Gather information first**: just like pre-modeling data preparation.
-   **Find patterns**: similar to descriptive models identifying trends.
-   **Make predictions**: drawing from past experiences, much like predictive models.
-   **Make decisions**: choosing the best action, just like prescriptive models.

We start by gathering information (pre-modeling), focus on what matters (feature engineering), recognize patterns (descriptive models), anticipate outcomes (predictive models), and, when possible, make decisions to optimize results (prescriptive models). Then we deploy our model by communicating to others—though whether that "model" is fair, accurate, or completely overfitted to our own biases is a whole other discussion (and probably a debate waiting to happen).

| **Stage**                           | **Key Concepts**                                                       | **Purpose**                                             |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pre-Modeling (Data Preparation)** | Outlier Detection, Data Cleaning, Transformations, Scaling, Imputation | Ensures clean, high-quality data before modeling.       |
| **Feature Engineering**             | Variable Selection, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)                 | Reduces dimensionality and improves model performance.  |
| **Descriptive Models**              | Summary Statistics, Data Visualization, Clustering                     | Identifies patterns, trends, and structure in data.     |
| **Predictive Models**               | Supervised Learning, Time-Series Forecasting                           | Finds hidden relationships and forecasts future trends. |
| **Prescriptive Models**             | Optimization, Simulation, Game Theory, Reinforcement Learning          | Recommends actions to maximize desired outcomes.        |
| **Post-Modeling (Deployment)**      | Cross-validation, Model Evaluation, Bias Detection, Interpretability   | Ensures reliability, fairness, and usability of models. |

Understanding this structure helps clarify **when and why different techniques are used**. Not every project needs all three modeling types (descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive), but seeing how they interact allows for **better problem-solving and decision-making**.

And just like AI, we’re constantly learning, adapting, refining, and making decisions based on experience. Whether we’re analyzing data, forecasting the future, or optimizing outcomes, these models aren’t just shaping technology; they reflect how we think, reason, and make sense of the world.
