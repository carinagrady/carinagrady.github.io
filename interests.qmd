I've always been drawn to the new and different: the ideas that push boundaries, challenge assumptions, and redefine what's possible. Whether it's uncovering patterns in data, questioning long-held beliefs in technology, or exploring the social forces that shape our world, I love the process of discovery. I'm drawn to understanding how things work—not just taking them at face value, but exploring different perspectives and possibilities to see what else might be there.

That's why I find myself at the intersection of engineering, analytics, and the humanities. I know it might not seem like the most obvious combination (after all, there is left brain and right brain; numbers and logic on one side, stories and human experience on the other), but to me, they're deeply connected.

Engineering and analytics give us the tools to build and understand complex systems, from energy grids to economic models. But the humanities help us ask the right questions. They remind us that technology doesn't exist in a vacuum; it shapes and is shaped by people, culture, and history. To truly innovate, we need both—the precision of data and the depth of human insight.

Data can reveal social truths that impacts every indiviudal, engineered solutions can be more effective when they consider human behavior, and storytelling and history can influence innovation. The world is built on connections between people, ideas, and disciplines. For me, the best way to make an impact is by embracing that interconnectedness, by considering what happens when we bring these fields together. This consideration fuels my curiosity, my work, and my passion for exploring the bigger picture.
