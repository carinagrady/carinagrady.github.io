Below are selections from my artistic portfolio, including fiction, poetry, spoken word, dance, photography, songwriting, music performance, and visual arts. My strongest work is in fiction and poetry, though many of those pieces are reserved for future publication.

## Fiction

**The Serpent's Utopia**, published in a local anthology on the theme of crossroads, is a spoken-word short story inspired by Genesis that explores how growth emerges only when we embrace discomfort and risk.

This piece was written to be heard. Press play to listen to the recorded performance. <audio controls style="width:100%;"> <source src="portfolio_files/fiction_spoken_word_the_serpents_utopia.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"> Your browser does not support the audio element. </audio> <iframe src="portfolio_files/fiction_the_serpents_utopia.pdf" width="100%" height="400px"></iframe>

What an incredible joy it is to gift poem & art to my favorite small business. I adore the summers filled with bike rides to the local gelateria run by two sisters. The love and tears received warmed my heart.

## Dance

My partner and I won third place in a **Salsa Competition** with our very first performance and original choreography. I usually dance socially with improvised moves and musicality, but I really enjoyed leaning into the story and emotion for this piece.

## Songwriting

All songs were created in 2022 to explore lyric and melody. <br><br> <video controls width="50%"> <source src="portfolio_files/song_i_want_to_live.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <br><br> <video controls width="50%"> <source src="portfolio_files/song_the_life_we_live.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <br>

This song began at a Poetry On Demand stand in Asheville, NC. I shared a few words, and the poet wove them into a poem. I loved it so much that I made it into a song. The original poem is included below. <img src="portfolio_files/lyric_inspos.jpg" width="500px" style="display:block; margin:auto;"/>

## Visual Art

This garage mural was a collaboration between my friend, her husband, my sister, and me. It has since become a neighborhood landmark, bringing smiles to those who pass by.
